# TRANGE

## Summary

True Range: the greatest of today's high-low span and the two gaps between yesterday's close and today's high/low. Base volatility measure used to build ATR/NATR. Larger values mean wider or gappier bars (higher volatility).

## Formula

TR = max( high - low, |prevClose - high|, |prevClose - low| )

## Notes

- The first bar produces no value because it has no prior close; unlike some definitions, it does not fall back to the high-low range for that bar.

## Inputs

- `inHigh` — High price of each bar
- `inLow` — Low price of each bar
- `inClose` — Close price of each bar

## Outputs

- `outReal` — True Range value per bar
