# CDL3WHITESOLDIERS

## Summary

A three-candle pattern of consecutive white candles with progressively higher closes, each opening within/near the prior body and each with a very short upper shadow. It is a bullish reversal signal. A hit (+100) is bullish, signaling a reversal (most meaningful in a downtrend, which the code does not verify).

## Notes

- Does not verify the prior downtrend the pattern classically assumes for significance.

## Inputs

- `inOpen` — Open price of each bar
- `inHigh` — High price of each bar
- `inLow` — Low price of each bar
- `inClose` — Close price of each bar

## Outputs

- `outInteger` — +100 when the pattern is detected, 0 otherwise; never negative (three white soldiers is always bullish)
