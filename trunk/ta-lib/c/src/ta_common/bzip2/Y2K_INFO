Y2K status of bzip2 and libbzip2, versions 0.1, 0.9.0 and 0.9.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Informally speaking:
   bzip2 is a compression program built on top of libbzip2, 
   a library which does the real work of compression and 
   decompression.  As far as I am aware, libbzip2 does not have 
   any date-related code at all.

   bzip2 itself copies dates from source to destination files 
   when compressing or decompressing, using the 'stat' and 'utime' 
   UNIX system calls.  It doesn't examine, manipulate or store the 
   dates in any way.  So as far as I can see, there shouldn't be any 
   problem with bzip2 providing 'stat' and 'utime' work correctly 
   on your system.

   On non-unix platforms (those for which BZ_UNIX in bzip2.c is
   not set to 1), bzip2 doesn't even do the date copying.

   Overall, informally speaking, I don't think bzip2 or libbzip2 
   have a Y2K problem.

Formally speaking:
